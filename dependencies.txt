 Containerization specifics:
 Dockerfile creates an image of django applications
 Docker compose file pulls image of postgres and creates a container for db, and builds the image of django created through dockerfile and creates a container for it.
 Puts both the containers in the same network called my network.

 Now, on doing docker-compose up, the development server will be started
 On a new terminal on the side, we should do docker exec -it mydjangoapp bash
 This will make us enter the container.
 Once, we are in, we write the following commands:
 python manage.py makemigrations
 python manage.py migrate     
 python manage.py createsuperuser
